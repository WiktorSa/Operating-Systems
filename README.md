# Operating-Systems
Simulations made for Operating Systems course (laboratory) at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology (Politechnika Wroclawska)
Every algorithm is implement in Python 3.9

# 1. Simulation 1 - SO1
Implement algorithms that schedule access to the CPU for upcoming processes. Perform simulation and calculate the average waiting time for every algorithm:
Implemented algorithms:
1. First Come First Served
2. Shortest Job First
3. Round Robin

# 2. Simulation 2 - SO2
Implement different disk scheduling algorithms. Calculate the times it takes for every request to be finished. Include in your simluation that some requests may be real time.
Implemented algorithms:
1. First Come First Served
2. Shortest Seek Time First
3. SCAN
4. C-SCAN
Implemented algorithms that support real-tinme requests:
1. EDF
2. FD-SCAN

# 3. Simulation 3 - SO3
Implement different algorithms of replacing pages. Calculate the average number of error pages for every algorithm
Implemented algorithms:
1. First In First Out
2. Optimal
3. Least Recently Used
4. Approximated LRU
5. Random

# 4. Simulation 4 - SO4
Implement algorithms that simulates replacing pages for at least 10 different processes. Calculate the average number of error pages for every algorithm
Implemented algorithms:
1. Equal Algorithm
2. Proportional Algorithm
3. Page Fault Frequency
4. Working Set

# 5. Simulation 5 - OS5
Implement 3 algorithms that simulate the way processes can be distributed to processors:
Implemented algorithms:
1. Algorithm in which the process firstly tries to be executed on other processors than the original processor and in the end gets executed on the original processor
2. Algorithm in which the process firstly tries to be executed on the original processor and later if needed searches for another processor
3. Improvement of algorithm 2. Processors that have a very small load try to take some processes from processors with a very high load
