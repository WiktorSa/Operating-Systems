# Operating-Systems
Simulations made for Operating Systems course (laboratory) at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology (Politechnika Wroclawska)
Every algorithm is implement in Python 3.9

# 1. Simulation 1 - SO1
Implement algorithms that schedule access to the CPU for upcoming processes. Perform simulation and calculate the average waiting time for every algorithm:
Implemented algorithms:
1. First Come First Served
